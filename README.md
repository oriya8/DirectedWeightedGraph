# The purpose of the assignment
The purpose of this assignment was to create a representation of a directed weighted graph.
Further explanation on such graphs can be found in the link: http://math.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/directedAndEdgeWeightedGraphs/.

# The body of the assignment
The assignment included three main parts:
*Creating a representation of a directed weighted graph, using different classes such as Node, Edge and so on.
*Implementing different algorithms that can be used on such graph – for example finding the shortest route between two given nodes.
*Executing a graphic representation of the whole project – including the graph itself and also a visual performance of the different algorithms that can be performed on such graph. 

# Some more on the algorithms
the concepts that stand behind some of the functions that can be performed on the graph are somewhat famous. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm) and the Dijkstra's algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) are only some of the concepts and ideas that were used in this assignment, helping in finding the fastest solution to solve mathematical problems
